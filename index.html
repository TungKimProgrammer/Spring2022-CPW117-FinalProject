                <h2>Why I Am Here</h2>
                <h5>Why Am I in College?</h5>
                <p>In July 2020, I returned to the US after 4 years living in Vietnam, with a little cash. One month later, my wife and my 2-year-old son arrived in the US under immigration visas. One of my friends had told me that driving for Uber and Lyft in Seattle area made good money and many Vietnamese people worked for Boeing with high pay rate. In September 2020, I decided to move my family from a summer-land Atlanta, GA to a winter-land Washington state, a new land. I told my wife that we would start from zero, people can do it, we can do it. On the day we landed, my friend told me that Uber and Lyft were slow because of Covid and Boeing just laid off 27,000 employees. On the next day, the landlord told me he was sorry that he decided to sell the house. I was like dropped into the ocean and I did not know where to find coasts. My son was little and my wife was 8 month-pregnant. There were a lot of issues I had to fix in a very short time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A car: I had to call my family and friends to borrow money to buy a car. Without a car, I couldn&rsquo;t do anything. I googled and googled, called and called everywhere. On day 4, I found a car.</li>
                    <li>Insurance and OB/GYN doctor: While searching for the car, I did some research for insurance for my family. It had been over a month; my wife had not been seen by a doctor. It&rsquo;s so much different between states. After getting the insurance, I had to find a OBGYN doctor that spoke Vietnamese. My wife&rsquo;s English is zero. It took me days calling back and forth to get an appointment with a doctor. The receptionist at the doctor office was surprise to know that I could get the insurance in a very short time at that point.</li>
                    <li>Driver's licenses: is a must before anything. Due to Covid, there were no available appointments at any DOL offices throughout the State. All appointments were fully booked 1 month in advance. Many people&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s licenses had been expired for almost a year and unable to renew. There was nothing I could do but getting up early in the morning and going online and check every location every single hour. Finally, I found 3 available appointments in a row at 1-hour-drive location. Wow, I was so lucky.</li>
                    <li>A job: I called and submitted applications anywhere I could. On day 10, I received 2 phone call interviews and got accepted accordingly. I picked the job as a production worker at Persona Nutrition because they had a shift from 2PM &ndash; 11 PM. I could be able to take my wife to doctor in the morning.</li>
                    <li>A place to live: was such a big issue. Apartment complex requires proof of income and employment. At that point I had nothing. Only choice was to get a shared room with Vietnamese people. But no one would have share with a big family: 2 adults, 1 kid, and 1 upcoming baby. My wife and I searched days and nights on Facebook, in the group of Vietnamese people. We got lucky eventually. One Vietnamese family opened their arms to us. They let us rented the basement of the house. And it was only 5 minutes to Valley Medical Center where our doctor and hospital were.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Those bullets above were accomplished within 2 weeks. We lived in the first house in two weeks and I started my job on 09/31/2020. We moved to new place on 10/01/2020. The first chapter in WA was short but productive.</p>
                <p>We were struggling on a little budget. The rent in WA is way too high compared to GA. I took another job at UPS, a seasonal personal vehicle driver (PVD) until 12/31/2020. I worked at UPS from 8:30 AM to 5PM and Persona from 6 PM to 11 PM. I worked 7 days a week.</p>
                <p>My wife gave birth to my daughter on 10/28/2020. My son was the only excepted kid allowed in the Birth Center. He was running around while my wife was in labor. I have no friends and family in WA to help babysit my son. My parents and my brother were visiting Vietnam and got tuck there because of Covid. Everything went well at the hospital.</p>
                <p>The whole night shift was laid off because of business reduction. I received unemployment benefits. During my time at Persona, I had chances to talk to Vietnamese employees who had family members working for BOEING and other big firms. I understood the importance of a degree when applying for a job with big companies in WA. I found out that I could apply for training benefits. With training benefits, I could go to college and still got paid. I found Computer Programming Program at Clover Park Technical College on the Eligible Training Providers list. And this program offered online classes.</p>
                <p>This opportunity is a big win-win to me. I can go to school to get a degree. I also get paid to support my family. I can take online classes and it is the best fit for me at present situation. I am still able to take my wife to work and the kids to school and pick them up at end of the day. A new door has been open for me.</p>
                <h5>Where are you going?</h5>
                <p>I was a spoiled son and I didn't find the meaning of life until the age of 25 when my parents were scammed by their friends and they lost everything. I stepped into life empty when my friends graduated from college and got jobs. The only thing I could do is to change myself and try hard. After years struggling and surviving, I have gained some knowledge and skills. I help people everywhere I go, and I do receive helps from strangers. It is impossible to please everyone but I can tell many people love me. My wife and I also have some investments in Vietnam. But we tell each other, we save it for retirement. We should start from the ground here. There&rsquo;s one saying &ldquo;Tough times create strong men. Strong men create easy times. Easy times create weak men. Weak men create tough times. We have to raise warriors&rdquo;. We try to be strong men and warriors ourselves.</p>
                <p>I am currently on my one-way journey of life to take my family to success. My wife works for a nail salon now. Her English is getting a little bit better and better every day. My son is going for PreK this fall. The daycare says that he&rsquo;s very smart and outstand among other kids although he still has speech delay. My parents&rsquo; health has been improved since returning to the US. So far, I have been doing good at school with load of support from instructors and classmates.</p>
                <p>Being at where I am standing now, I am so grateful for all the helps I received from people around. I have learnt a lot and I also have been motivated from and by people. Attending Clover Park Technical College is a huge thing to me. It does not only give me chance to study but open my eyes to many things I have not known about. I understand that I still have a long way to go but I will take my time slowly but strongly. I prefer to build a strong foundation of knowledge and skills.</p>
                <p>My goals after attending Clover Park Technical College are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To get a job with high paying rate: I have talked to one guy who works for Costco now. He has the same major with me. He started working for Costco at a low level when he was in college. After his graduation he applied for a position with his degree. Because he was already an employee so he got the job before outside candidates. I can follow his steps or I can apply for internship. It might help me to get a job easier. My next step now is focus on my study. I have learnt skills from my lectures such as deep level processing, SMART goals and WOOP process, principles to get Most out of Studying, etc. Those lectures are very useful for me.</li>
                    <li>To open a nail salon for my wife: My wife has been with me since I was empty handed. We have conquered levels of life together. We will start from a small salon and expand later when the business picks up. We are trying to save up, we are halfway so far.</li>
                    <li>To buy a house within good school zone: Anything my wife and I are trying to do now just for one main goal, raise and support our kids. We wish they will have a good education and happy life. To achieve this goal, I have helped my wife build credit. Her FICO score is over 790 now. I had some problems with my credit in the past but I am working to fix them. We plan our monthly budget and try to save up for the down payment.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>There are not only rainy days but also sunny ones. To me, anything happens for a reason. Bad things might happen but they give me experience. It&rsquo;s just how we face the problems. My life has been up and down but I have never lost faith, in me or anyone or anything. There&rsquo;s always the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
